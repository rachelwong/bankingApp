# Banking terminal application

A small exercise practicing inheritance, object-oriented principles using Ruby.

Grateful to have received advice and guidance from instructor Matthew Stubbs at Coder Academy.

### Progress
- Version 1 no use of classes, objects `bankaccount.rb`
- Improved upon version 1 using one primitive class structure `bankapp2.rb`
- Used objects and classes to separate between user input, feedback screens and account functionalities `bankapp_classObj.rb`
